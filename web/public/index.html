<h1>Welcome to HackThisAI!</h1>
<p>HackThisAI is a series of capture the flag (CTF) challenges to educate and train adversarial machine learning techniques. CTFs are a common way information security professionals learn new skills and compete across the community. Challenges are categorized so that players can focus on specific topics. The HackThisAI challenges should be approachable for new data scientists, machine learning engineers, and traditional infosec professionals, but progress in difficulty to a point that requires combinations of advanced techniques and creative approaches.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Often, you'll see adversarial machine learning tasks classified into these buckets.</p> 
<ul>
    <li>Evade the model. Can you evade or fool the model? In many applications, model classification is used in control flow: if model.predict() == A: do this; else: do that. If you can successfully control the model output, you may have some sway over control flow. Evasion is also a fundamental task that may help with influence and steal challenges.</li>
    <li>Influence the model. Can you change how the model operates? You may have direct or indirect access to training data or model training steps.</li>
    <li>Steal the model. Can you steal, extract, or invert the model? In traditional hacking, you might want to use access to exfiltrate a model binary. However, in these challenges, you'll want to interact with the model API to learn things about it's structure and find a way to recreate it.</li>
    <li>Infer membership. Was this data point used in the model training process? If you can determine that, you could violate privacy considerations or start learning things about the training dataset.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenge Directory</h2>
New challenges are constantly being developed and released. Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/HackThisAI">@HackThisAI</a> on Twitter for updates (or join in and contribute your own).

The linked READMEs describe the process for locally-hosted challenges. Replace localhost:5000 with the IP:PORT combination from the link. For instance, http://localhost:5001/check becomes http://3.101.26.248:5001/check. If you're having trouble submitting challenges, check out the submission helper in the linked GitHub repo or contact me on Twitter.
